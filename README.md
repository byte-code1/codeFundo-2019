Block chain application in democracy.
Fake news, voting frauds, a rise in populism and divided public opinions — democracies around the world are under constant pressure online from the digital revolution. With the increased presence of technology in our daily lives, it is suffice to say that our personal data and privacy are both a concern, especially when it comes to elections. Too often we hear how governments are able to intrude on our privacy through the internet, social media, mobile phone data and much more.

The solution:

On the bright side, technology can also be used to improve an election and make it fairer.Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) are flawed by their centralized design. In fact, during the Voter Hacking Village at Defcon in Las Vegas last year, hackers were able to penetrate the standard EVMs used in US elections in just over an hour (CNET).We plan to improve the voting by introducing the block chain technology during voting.This works in the following way: -

1.A platform will be created embedding programming languages such as java,javascript,python,c,html,css and python to create a enviornment capable of performing specific tasks.
2.The system will be based upon password protected credentials and blockchain verification, this entire system will be based on encryption of the digital Key as name of the voter and will be based upon RSA(Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) encryption.
3.Each user will have an account which will be password protected.
4.User will login to the system with User ID as his ID and Password as his Digitally Signed ID,PHP form based system will be applied which will accept the user entries and store the entries in a Cloud Database.
5.The server will then verify his signature and record his vote in the form of a block.(this will ensure that a person does not vote twice and that does not impersonates others),The signature verification will be based on Java!!!.
6. Each vote cast will be encrypted with a public key and the information will be added to the blockchain via a new block.
7. After all votes are cast, the counting committee will decrypt the votes with the private key and count blocks accordingly.
