Block chain application in democracy.
Fake news, voting frauds, a rise in populism and divided public opinions â€” democracies around the world are under constant pressure online from the digital revolution. With the increased presence of technology in our daily lives, it is suffice to say that our personal data and privacy are both a concern, especially when it comes to elections. Too often we hear how governments are able to intrude on our privacy through the internet, social media, mobile phone data and much more.

The solution:

On the bright side, technology can also be used to improve an election and make it fairer.Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) are flawed by their centralized design. In fact, during the Voter Hacking Village at Defcon in Las Vegas last year, hackers were able to penetrate the standard EVMs used in US elections in just over an hour (CNET).We plan to improve the voting by introducing the block chain technology during voting.This works in the following way: -

1. Each user will have an id and will use it to login to the system with user id as his id and password as his digitally signed id.
    The computer will then verify his signature and record that he voted (this will ensure that a person does not vote twice and that no 
    impersonates others).
2. Each vote cast will be encrypted with a public key and the information will be added to the blockchain via a new block.
3. After all votes are cast, the counting committee will decrypt the votes with the private key and count accordingly.
